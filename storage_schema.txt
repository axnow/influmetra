How data is stored in mongo:

Profiles:

influ.profiles

entry:
{
    _id: <twitter numerical id>
    timestamp: //timestamp of latest retrieval
    profile: { //profile as in api v2 }
    profile_history:[
            {
                timestamp: <timestamp>
                profile: {profile, apiv2}
            }
        ]
    follows: [//ids of profiles followed by person    ]
    followed_by [//ids of known folowers]
    //follows history/followers history to be added when needed
    tags: [//list of string tags used by program]
}


Lists:
influ.lists

{
    _id: <twitter numerical id>
    timestamp: <timestamp of last list retrieval>
    list: <twitter list object with details>
    tags: [..] //tags to be attached to list items
    members:[ <ids of list members>]
    //list history to be added later if necessary
}
